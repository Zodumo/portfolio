# **Portfolio**


## **Description**

This repository is for my portfolio website that showcases all of the skills I have gained and  projects that I have completed so far. 

In the latest iteration of this portfolio, I have only showcased my HTML and CSS skills and expect to improve the build of the website itself and include more projects as I develop my skills. 

## **Access/Installation**

This portfolio has been deployed on GitHub pages and can be accessed via the link below:

https://zodumo.github.io/portfolio/

The below image shows what the landing page should look like once you have clicked the link:

## **Usage**

The three main sections of this site can be be accessed either by manually scrolling down to find them or by clicking on the different options in the navigation area. 

To view the different projects, scroll to the 'Work' section of the page and click on the project to access the deployed version. 

(Please note that currently only the Horiseon webpage is the only one that redirects to a deployed page)

The website is currently responsive and should be viewable on different screen sizes.
